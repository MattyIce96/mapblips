Inside the code you can see my comments on how to properly create them!

inside the comments will also share where you can get the sprites, and colors etc!

Please note;
1) x, y, z - are FLOAT numbers, so even if your /coords state "123", you MUST put, "123.0" or else it will break, even the most experienced coders miss this too, dont forget to add in the - if your coord has that for which ever xyz, or else it will shoot the opposite direction.

It is NOT recommended to change the scale more than 1.0, as this will create a HUGE blip. Not very visually appealing to anyone.

drag over the resource to your resource area, where ever of your choosing
1) ensure blips
  
I hope this has helped you!

If it has, dont forget to share the love
